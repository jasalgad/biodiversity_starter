INTRODUCCIÃ“N

In this project we are going to analyze the species that are found in different national parks to evaluate their state of conservation and what situation they are in, whether or not they are in danger of extinction and whether or not they are acting on the basis of their particular situation and if there is any pattern that relates those categories of fauna of those who are not classified with those who are, all in order to make some prediction to act better.
This study must be able to respond to what was proposed.
SCOPE

The way to carry out this study will first be based on knowing and understanding the databases and knowing the variables we have; once understood we will proceed to analyze them and relate them to each other through graphs and summarized data to draw conclusions and patterns that serve us to respond to the objective of the study.
To do this, we will set ourselves a series of objectives of analysis of the databases, we will analyze it and we will draw some conclusions, the fulfillment of those objectives should give us sufficient information for what is questioned.
GOALS

The objectives of this analysis are:

1- Distribution of data:

    A) How many species are there, how many categories, etc.

    B) How many national parks is the study based, how many species are distributed per park.

    C) In what situation each of the species is: Those who are not at risk, those who are, those who are in recovery, those who are in danger of extinction, etc., quantify it and summarize it.

    D) Conservation status of the species in question


2- Exposure of the information well summarized in data, or with graphs

3- Search for patterns

4- Draw conclusions according to the data obtained
